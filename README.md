<h1> Python Project 1: Band Name Generator </h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project is for day 1 of the 100 Days of Code challenge that I'm completing as part of the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp with Dr. Angela Yu from the App Brewery. Each project in this challenge will be using Python so that I can grow my skills in software development and back-end technologies.</p>
<p>This project is a simple band name generator that will use the name of the city you grew up in with the name of your pet to generate a potential band name.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>I have previously covered most of the teachings in day 1 through other online training; however, one new thing I learned was the use of "\n" to create a new line. This was beneficial in improving the readability of the output.</p>
