<h1> Python Project 1: Band Name Generator </h1>
<p><em>Updated 15 October 2024: Reattempted module and committed new changes to practice what I've learned. Main.py is cleaned up, including comments, and I have added ASCII art for the logo in a separate art.py file.</em></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This project is for day 1 of the 100 Days of Code challenge that I'm completing as part of the Complete Python Pro Bootcamp with Dr. Angela Yu from the App Brewery. Each project in this challenge will be using Python so that I can grow my skills in software development.</p>
<p>This project is a simple band name generator that uses the name of the city you grew up in with the name of your pet to generate a potential band name.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>I have previously covered most of the teachings in day 1 through other online training; however, one new thing I learned was the use of "\n" to create a new line. This was beneficial in improving the readability of the output.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: I also learned how to import files and create ASCII art later in the course, so I reattempted this module to clean up my code and add an ASCII logo.</p>
